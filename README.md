I’m a Senior Cloud & Platform DevOps Engineer focused on designing and operating enterprise-grade platforms that scale across teams, environments, and regulatory boundaries.

My work centers on building durable systems the kind that reduce operational risk, shorten delivery cycles, and remain understandable years after the original authors move on.

I operate at the layer where **architecture, security, governance, and developer velocity** meet.
